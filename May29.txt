Step 1: Get a Chrome account because Metamask is a Chrome extension. 

Step 2: In your browser, type: “metamask.io”. Click the Download button. 


Step 3: After downloading, this crypto wallet will allow you to manage transactions in the Etherium network. 

Step 4: Choose the sepolia which is a test network. (In settings, set ON the test networks to enable this feature)

Step 5: To put some Eth in your account, go to https://sepoliafaucet.com/ and sign up your Metamask account.
 
Step 6: While in the Sepolia network, an initial amount of P0.5 Eth will be shown in your account.
 
Step 7: You may try to send to your co-trainee some Eth by clicking the Send button, some “Gas fee” 
Will also be deducted from your Eth amount. However, this is very very minimal. 

Step 8: After sending the Eth amount, you would see that it has been deducted from your wallet.
